General Information
-------------------

FCGI-ProcManager is a process manager for FCGI.  By implementing the
process manager in perl, we can more finely tune FastCGI performance, and 
we can take CPU and memory advantages of fast forks and copy-on-right UNIX
process management characteristics.


Installation
------------

FCGI-ProcManager is expected to compile and run on all systems which
support normal UNIX fork/wait semantics.  FCGI-ProcManager is known to
compile and run on the following systems:

 - Linux (2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x)
 - Solaris (2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7)
 - Digital UNIX 4.0
 - NetBSD 1.4

Full installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
To build,

  perl Makefile.PL
  make all
  make install
